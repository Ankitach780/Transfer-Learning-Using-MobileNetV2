# Transfer-Learning-Using-MobileNetV2
Used the MobileNetV2 model, which is pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset, to perform a related task in transfer learning. By leveraging the knowledge from its initial training, the model can effectively tackle similar image recognition tasks with a smaller dataset and fewer computational resources.
